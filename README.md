# Internal Unity Packages

This repository serves as a catalog for Unity packages developed in-house at Created by Catalyst. These packages have been created with the intention of being reusable across multiple projects, improving efficiency and maintainability of our codebase.

## Getting Started

To use any of these packages, download the package you need and import it into your Unity project. Each package comes with its own set of instructions included in its directory.

## Packages

Here you will find a brief description of each package currently in this repository:

1. **CustomTweens:** The CustomTweens package provides a framework of abstract classes for creating customizable, reusable tweening behaviors in Unity, using the powerful DOTween library.
2. **InputReaders:** A generic input reader for creating customizable and scalable input sytems.
3. **...**

_Note: Each package has its own README file inside its directory where you can find more detailed information._

## Contributing

Contributions to improve or extend these packages are always welcome. If you're a member of Created by Catalyst team and you've developed a new package that you believe should be shared, please follow these steps:

1. Document your package. Ensure that it includes a README with instructions on how to install and use the package.
2. Add your package to the appropriate directory in this repository.
3. Update this main README to include a brief description of your package in the Packages list.

For bug fixes, improvements, or new features to existing packages, please create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
